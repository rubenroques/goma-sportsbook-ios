Setting a reasonable budget is a good way to ensure that you don't spend more than you can afford.\n\nChecking your game history regularly will allow you to keep an eye on your spending and detect any possible drift. If you start feeling negative emotions like frustration or stress, take a break and do something else to relax.\n\nFinally, it's important not to let the game take over your daily responsibilities and obligations. If you feel that gambling is starting to negatively impact your life, don't hesitate to talk to your loved ones and seek help if necessary.";

Les joueurs récréatifs sont prudents dans leurs mises et ne jouent pas de manière compulsive ou excessive.\n\nLe jeu problématique, quant à lui, peut affecter la vie quotidienne d'une personne de manière négative. Les joueurs pathologiques ont du mal à contrôler leur comportement de jeu et peuvent continuer à jouer malgré les conséquences négatives qui en résultent, telles que des problèmes financiers, des conflits familiaux ou professionnels, des problèmes de santé mentale ou physique, etc.\n\nIl est donc important de mettre en place des mesures pour aider à prévenir et à détecter le jeu excessif.

\t2. Établissez un budget : Définissez une limite budgétaire claire avant de commencer à parier. Assurez-vous que cet argent est quelque chose que vous pouvez vous permettre de perdre sans affecter votre vie quotidienne.

\t3. Limitez le temps de jeu : Fixez-vous des limites de temps pour vos sessions de jeu. Cela peut vous aider à éviter de passer trop de temps à parier et à maintenir un équilibre sain entre le jeu et d'autres activités.

\t4. Évitez de récupérer vos pertes : Ne tentez pas de récupérer l'argent que vous avez perdu en augmentant vos mises. Cela peut entraîner des pertes plus importantes et des comportements risqués.

\t5. Utilisez des outils de gestion des comptes : Renseignez des limites raisonnables que vous pouvez vous permettre de perdre pour réguler vos dépenses et vos mises. Utilisez ces fonctionnalités pour rester en contrôle.

\t6. Ne pariez pas sous l'influence : Évitez de parier lorsque vous êtes sous l'influence de l'alcool, de médicaments ou de toute autre substance. Cela peut altérer votre jugement et vous amener à prendre des décisions impulsives.

\t7. Soyez conscient de vos émotions : Si vous commencez à ressentir des émotions négatives telles que le stress, la frustration ou l'anxiété liées au jeu, prenez une pause. Ne pariez pas lorsque vous êtes émotionnellement vulnérable.

\t8. Maintenir un lien social : Ne cache pas ta pratique du jeu à tes proches. Reste conscient de ton rapport au jeu, de tes gains et pertes, et discutes-en avec ton entourage.

\t9. Sécuriser votre compte : Ne partagez jamais vos identifiants avec des mineurs et assurez-vous de protéger vos accès pour éviter toute connexion non autorisée.";
