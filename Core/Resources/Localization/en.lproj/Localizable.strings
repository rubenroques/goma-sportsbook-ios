Setting a reasonable budget is a good way to ensure that you don't spend more than you can afford.\n\nChecking your game history regularly will allow you to keep an eye on your spending and detect any possible drift. If you start feeling negative emotions like frustration or stress, take a break and do something else to relax.\n\nFinally, it's important not to let the game take over your daily responsibilities and obligations. If you feel that gambling is starting to negatively impact your life, don't hesitate to talk to your loved ones and seek help if necessary.";
