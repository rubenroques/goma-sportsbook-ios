# When you create a tag like: BCM-2.1.3(21309)
# The workflow will look for a matching entry with:
#   - version: "2.1.3"
#   - build: 21309
#
# Supported tag formats (all case-insensitive):
#   BCM-2.1.3(21309)      - Standard format
#   BCM-v2.1.3(21309)     - With 'v' prefix
#   bcm_2.1.3(21309)      - Underscore separator
#   bcm-2.1(21309)        - X.Y version format
#
# Dual Release: Each tag deploys to BOTH Staging AND Production automatically.
#
# If a matching entry is found, it will use the notes for Firebase distribution and Discord notification.
# If not found, it will use generic notes: "Build 21309 - Version 2.1.3"
