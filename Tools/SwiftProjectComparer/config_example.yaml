# Example configuration for Swift Project Comparer
# ------------------------------------------------

# Path to the base project directory (the one you're merging INTO)
# This should be your main project that will receive code from the legacy project
base_directory: "/Users/rroques/Desktop/GOMA/iOS/sportsbook-ios/"

# Path to the legacy project directory (the one you're merging FROM)
# This is the project that has diverged and contains code you want to identify
legacy_directory: "/Users/rroques/Desktop/GOMA/iOS/MultiBet-iOS"

# Directories to exclude from analysis (recommended)
# These are typically third-party dependencies or build artifacts
excluded_directories:
  - "Pods"
  - "Carthage"
  - "DerivedData"
  - ".git"
  - "fastlane"
  - "Scripts"
  - "Generated"

# Types to ignore in the comparison (optional)
# This is useful for common utility types that shouldn't be counted as missing
ignored_types:
  # Ignore these type names regardless of their kind (class, struct, enum, etc.)
  names:
    - "CodingKeys"
    - "Constants"
    - "AppDelegate"
    - "SceneDelegate"

  # Ignore types matching regex patterns
  patterns:
    - ".*Tests$"
    - "Test.*"
    - "Mock.*"

# Path where the comparison report should be saved
# If not provided, the report will be printed to the console
